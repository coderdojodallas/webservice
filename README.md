Synopsis
--------
As a strong believer in the open source movement, we thought it was important to publish the source code for our site and
develop it openly. Built with [Python](https://www.python.org/):snake:.

Getting Started
---------------
1. Clone the repository into the directory of your choosing
2. Navigate to the directory
3. Create your virtual environment with `python3 -m venv venv`. This will create a *venv* folder in your working directory.
   (For info on what this call is doing, see the [Python 3 virtual environment documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html))
4. Activate your virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate` on Mac/Linux or `call venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the packages used for the website
6. Make the file executable with `chmod a+x run.py` (Skip this step if you're on Windows)
7. Execute the file with `./run.py` on Mac/Linux or `python run.py` on Windows
8. Open your web browser and type `localhost:5000` in the address bar
9. Look at the website in awe
